Site still a prototype. All data uploaded will be deleted <br>
<br>
Features I want:<br>
Ability to create a sub/ dom account.<br>
Subs can search for doms.<br>
Sub and dom create contract, to symbolise ownership.<br>
Then the dom has access to a sub manager where they can manage all their subs<br>
They can set tasks.<br>
There is an option for the sub to submit tasks they have done, then the domme can approve it or set punishment<br>
It will automaticaly take tribute fee e.g. 50Â£ each week<br>
Sub has to pay to submit application<br>
Dom has public profile showing informations such as costs/ services she offers<br>
